          <summary>My kefir smells funky (or off)</summary>
          <p>Yep! It's probably fine, though.</p>
          <p>
            It smells worst right as you're straining and bottling it. It's
            warm, sour, yeasty, and full of carbon dioxide. Mine smells like a
            cross between warm beer and yoghurt at this stage. It'll smell less
            funky once it's cold, and some lemon peel in the second ferment
            really helps cut the funk as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another possibility: sunlight (or any kind of light) can make milk
            products taste weird, think cheese or butter left on the bench for a
            few hours, so make sure your kefir is in a dark place or an opaque
            container.
          </p>
          <p>
            Part of the difficulty is that we're not used to leaving milk out of
            the fridge so weird smells seem scary. I've never had any milk kefir
            go off as healthy grains will populates the milk very rapidly and
            prevent any other bacteria or moulds from getting started. Remember,
            fridges haven't been around very long! I've read that milk kefir
            lasts for weeks unrefrigerated, though I've never tried it myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, there is always a chance that you legitimately have an
            off batch. This could happen because your grains are very weak or
            dead, or your milk was already off. You could try giving your grains
            a good wash in cold tap water and making another batch, or just
            throw the grains out and get some fresh ones. Milk kefir is very
            robust so this seems unlikely to me, but it's always a possibility
            with fermenting.

          <p>
            That's fine, it's a little over-fermented but not off. Shake the
            kefir up to combine it again and strain it as usual.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shaking will increase the pressure (like shaking a bottle of
            lemonade) so open the container in the sink to avoid explosions and
            be extra careful if you're using a glass container that isn't made
            to withstand pressure.
          </p>
          <p>
            It might taste a bit stronger or more acidic than normal but there's
            nothing wrong with it. Primary fermentation speeds up in warmer
            temperatures so you can try keeping it in a cooler part of the house
            or reducing the fermentation time if you'd rather avoid this.
