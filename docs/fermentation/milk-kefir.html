          Milk kefir is a fermented drink made from animal milk with high counts
          of diverse probiotic strains.
        </p>
        <h2>Making Milk Kefir</h2>
        <h3>What You Need</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>milk kefir grains, 1-4 tablespoons</li>
          <li>Animal milk, 500-1000ml</li>
          <li>A jar for fermenting</li>
          <li>A bottle to store kefir in the fridge</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Put the kefir grains in the fermenting jar with the milk, covered
            loosely with the lid or cheesecloth so gas can escape
          </li>
          <li>
            Put the fermenting jar in a cupboard or other dark place for 24-48
            hours
          </li>
          <li>
            Strain the contents of the fermenting jar with a course sieve to
            separate the grains and the liquid
          </li>
          <li>
            Put the liquid into the storage bottle in the fridge, this is the
            kefir you drink
          </li>
          <li>Start again at step 1 with the grains in the sieve</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Optional</h3>
        You can add extra flavours to the kefir in the fridge in a "secondary
        fermentation." Lemon peel is a great place to start as it helps cut some
        of the more funky kefir flavours, but you can try other things too.
        Spices, fresh fruit, dried fruit, vanilla essence, etc. The kefir will
        ferment any new sugars you add, slowly in the fridge or faster out of
        the fridge if you want that. Have fun!

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <details name="faq">
          <summary>What is a primary ferment?</summary>
          <p>
            This is just the initial fermentation you do by putting the kefir
            grains in a container with milk and leaving it somewhere dark like a
            cupboard for a day or two. It finishes once you strain the kefir
            grains out and start the process again.
          </p>
          <p>
            This should only be done with animal milk, don't add fruit or extra
            sugars to your primary ferment.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details name="faq">
          <summary>What is a secondary ferment?</summary>
          <p>
            Additional fermentation that happens after you've removed the kefir
            grains from your milk (now kefir,) usually in the fridge with some
            extra fruit or flavouring in the bottle.
          </p>
          <p>
            After your primary ferment is finished and you've strained the
            grains out, you're left with the kefir you consume. At this point,
            the kefir is inoculated with all the bacteria and yeast from the
            kefir grains and will keep fermenting any residual sugars (and a
            bunch of other reactions.) Putting it in the fridge slows this extra
            fermentation down so it doesn't run out of sugars or get overly
            acidic too quickly. Some people like to add fresh or dried fruit at
            this point, or just flavour it a bit with some vanilla essence or
            some lemon peel. It's really up to you, it'll happily eat new sugars
            of any kind, or be just as happy without.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep in mind that you're only adding these to the kefir you put in
            the fridge to consume, NOT in the primary ferment with the kefir
            grains.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details name="faq">
          <summary>What kind of container should I use?</summary>
          <p>
            For the primary ferment, you want a jar or wide-mouth bottle around
            0.5-1L depending how much you want to make at once. Food grade
            plastic is convenient because it won't explode from pressure or
            smash if it slips out of your hands. You can also use glass or
            stainless steel, just be aware of pressure build up during
            fermentation that can explode glass that's not meant to handle it
            (which is extremely messy.) Some metal jar lids can also react to
            the acids in the kefir and get rusty, so watch out for that and stop
            using those if it happens.
          </p>
          <p>
            The secondary ferment is a bit easier because it's fermenting much
            slower in the fridge. I use glass milk bottles with metal lids that
            don't seem to react to the acids in the kefir. I haven't had any
            major pressure buildup yet and I open the bottles most days anyway
            to get some kefir. You want something easy to clean with a wide
            mouth for pouring thick kefir into or adding fruit, etc.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details name="faq">
          <summary>My kefir smells funky (or off)</summary>
          <p>Yep! It's probably fine, though.</p>
          <p>
            It smells worst right as you're straining and bottling it. It's
            warm, sour, yeasty, and full of carbon dioxide. Mine smells like a
            cross between warm beer and yoghurt at this stage. It'll smell less
            funky once it's cold, and some lemon peel in the second ferment
            really helps cut the funk as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another possibility: sunlight (or any kind of light) can make milk
            products taste weird, think cheese or butter left on the bench for a
            few hours, so make sure you're fermenting in a dark place or an
            opaque container.
          </p>
          <p>
            Part of the difficulty is that we're not used to leaving milk out of
            the fridge so weird smells seem scary. I've never had any milk kefir
            go off as healthy grains will populate the milk very rapidly and
            prevent any other bacteria or moulds from getting started. Remember,
            fridges haven't been around very long! I've read that milk kefir
            lasts for weeks unrefrigerated, though I've never tried it myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, there is always a chance that you legitimately have an
            off batch. This could happen because your grains are very weak or
            dead, or your milk was already off. You could try giving your grains
            a good wash in cold tap water and making another batch, or just
            throw the grains out and get some fresh ones. Milk kefir is very
            robust so this seems unlikely to me, but it's always a possibility.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details name="faq">
          <summary>My kefir has split/separated</summary>
          <p>
            That's fine, it's a little over-fermented but not off. Shake the
            kefir up to combine it again and strain it as usual.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shaking will increase the pressure (like shaking a bottle of
            lemonade) so open the container in the sink to avoid explosions and
            be extra careful if you're using a glass container that isn't made
            to withstand pressure.
          </p>
          <p>
            It might taste a bit stronger or more acidic than normal but there's
            nothing wrong with it. Primary fermentation speeds up in warmer
            temperatures so you can try keeping it in a cooler part of the house
            or reducing the fermentation time if you'd rather avoid this.
          </p>

        <details name="faq">
          <summary>
            Should I cover my primary ferment with a lid or cheesecloth?
          </summary>
          <p>
            You can do either and you'll see varied beliefs online. I haven't
            noticed much of a difference either way so I just do what's easy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I lightly place the lid over the top of my jar without screwing it
            down. That allows carbon dioxide to escape and keeps moulds and
            other bacteria out. The kefir grains are happy with or without
            oxygen and some people use cheesecloth instead to provide more air.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details name="faq">
          <summary>Is kefir alcoholic?</summary>
          <p>
            Very slightly but it's usually low enough to be classified as a
            non-alcoholic beverage in Australia. It's unlikely to get over 1%
            alcohol by volume, usually much less.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're finding it smells more like alcohol than normal, try
            giving your grains a rinse under cold tap water before you do your
            next batch. Sometimes the yeasts can become more dominant and a wash
            seems to help. Even so, the alcohol content will never be high.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details name="faq">
          <summary>Can I use plant milk instead of animal milk?</summary>
          <p>
            <em>Maybe</em>, but I would advise using animal milk until you're
            comfortable with the process and have plenty of spare grains to
            experiment with.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have read of people successfully using various kinds of plant milk
            for short periods of time, but they're not as nutritious as animal
            milk so the kefir grains can get weaker over time. Your best bet is
            to alternate between animal and plant milk on a schedule that keeps
            them healthy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have also read of someone completely converting their milk kefir
            grains to live a vegan lifestyle for a year or more, but they were
            making their own plant milk with blended dates, seeds, nuts, etc.
            The bacteria in kefir do seem to eat all kinds of sugars so this
            does seem doable, but probably best done like this with whole foods
            to keep the bacteria healthy. This is not commonly done so I'd say
            keep some spare grains in the fridge in case it all goes wrong and
            you want to start over.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apparently the grains can live and reproduce in soymilk but will
            change in appearance and size due to the differences, so that might
            be a good starting point.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details name="faq">
          <summary>I have too many kefir grains</summary>
          <p>
            Happy grains will multiply, especially in warmer weather. This isn't
            necessarily a problem, but can speed up your primary fermentation
            faster than you want and result in stronger and more acidic kefir.
          </p>
          <p>Here are some options to deal with having too many:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Put some to sleep. There's an FAQ section on taking a break, check
              that out. This doesn't get rid of them, but it does give you a
              backup in the unlikely event that something catastrophic happens
              to your main batch.
            </li>
            <li>
              Give them to friends. They'll need about a tablespoon to get
              started.
            </li>
            <li>
              Blend them into a smoothie, they're apparently very good for you.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </details>
        <details name="faq">
          <summary>I'm going away / need a break</summary>
          <p>
            No worries, you can put your kefir grains to sleep for weeks to
            months at a time and they should be OK. Put some in a small jar with
            enough fresh milk to cover them and put them in the fridge or
            freezer. They should last months in the freezer, and weeks to months
            in the fridge. If they're in the fridge then change the milk every
            week or two if you can, but they're fairly robust.
          </p>
          <p>
            I sometimes cycle mine in out of the fridge on a weekly basis,
            especially in the summer when the fermentation is so fast. I'll make
            a couple of litres of kefir over a few days, then put my kefir
            grains in the fridge until I've run out. Then I just take the grains
            out of the fridge and add milk to start them up again.
          </p>
          <p>
            They might be a little sluggish when you first pull them out of the
            fridge, especially if they've been in there a while, but they should
            perk back up if you start a regular rhythm again.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details name="faq">
          <summary>What are the kefir grains made of?</summary>
          <p>
            Their structure is provided by a polysaccharide named kefiran,
            similar to cellulose, that one of the bacteria in the kefir grains
            produces. Kefiran clumps together to form the grains, and the grains
            provide a protective layer around the entire colony of
            microorganisms that live in there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kefiran is apparently very good for you so there's no worries about
            eating the grains, accidentally or otherwise.

          <summary>How clean does everything have to be?</summary>
          <p>
            Honestly? I only wash my bottles and primary fermenting jar once
            every week or two, usually I just strain a fresh batch of kefir and
            top up the bottle that's in the fridge, then put the grains back in
            the fermenting jar and add some more milk. The kefir colony seems to
            murder any pathogens that get into it. I obviously use clean
            utensils and wash my strainer well each time, but the kefir grains
            seem quite robust as long as they're happy and healthy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fermenting websites love to talk about everything being perfectly
            sterile for each batch and that seems important for commercial
            production, but it's way overkill for home fermentation. Your kefir
            will adapt to its local environment anyway, just like every
            sourdough starter is unique.

          <summary>What kind of animal milk should I use?</summary>
          <p>
            Cow, goat, or sheep are all good. It'll work just as well with
            full-cream or low fat, homogenised or not, pasteurised or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Non-homogenised milk or very fatty milk can cause the grains to get
            clogged up with yellowish milk fat which can look a bit unsightly
            but won't do any damage. Just rinse the grains to clear it if it
            bothers you.
          </p>
          <p>I haven't tried UHT milk but I don't see why it wouldn't work.</p>

          <summary>Where can I get kefir grains?</summary>
          <p>
            If you have a friend who makes milk kefir, ask them for some. The
            grains replicate on their own so they'll have too many at some
            point. You only need around 1 tablespoon to get started.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also buy some online, they'll survive express post. I bought
            mine from
            <a href="https://www.thefermentary.com.au/">The Fermentary</a> but
            there are plenty of others.

          <summary>How does kefir compare to probiotic tablets?</summary>
          <p>
            Milk kefir contains all the common probiotic strains found in
            probiotic tablets but usually more active (because it's not dried)
            and at higher concentrations, though the diversity and activity can
            vary based on climate and the milk you use.
          </p>
          <p>
            The studies I've read seem to agree that milk kefir has between 50
            and 100 strains of probiotic and beneficial yeasts in very high
            quantities, with a cup having 10 to 100 times more colony forming
            units than a probiotic tablet.

          <summary>How does kefir compare to yoghurt?</summary>
          <p>
            Commercial yoghurt is made with a couple of strains of thermophilic
            bacteria, meaning they function around 40C-50C, which is warmer than
            the human body. This produces creamy and nutritious yoghurt in a
            short space of time but doesn't provide any probiotics that will
            benefit humans.
