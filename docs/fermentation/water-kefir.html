          Water kefir is a fermented drink made from water and sugar with high
          counts of diverse probiotic strains. It tastes lightly fizzy and sour
          with varying sweetness depending on how long the fermentation goes.
          Many people find water kefir helps with digestive issues like food
          intolerances or IBS, and it's suitable for vegans unlike milk kefir
          (though milk kefir is more diverse if you're not vegan.)
        </p>
        <h2>Making Water Kefir</h2>
        <p>
          You can scale this up or down as needed depending on how many grains
          you have. You can also play around with the amounts and fermentation
          time to find what works for you. Relatively more liquid will increase
          fermentation time, while more grains will ferment faster.
        </p>
        <h3>What You Need</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Water kefir grains, 1 tablespoon</li>
          <li>
            Dechlorinated tap water, 250ml-500ml (leave a jug of tap water out
            overnight)
          </li>
          <li>White or raw sugar, 1 tablespoon per 250ml-500ml</li>
          <li>A pinch of salt</li>
          <li>
            A dried fig and a slice of lemon (optional but provides trace
            nutrients not found in refined sugar)
          </li>
          <li>
            A jar for fermenting with some way to release pressure, like an
            airlock, swing-top, or cheesecloth
          </li>
          <li>
            Pressure bottles to store kefir in the fridge, like swing tops or
            old soft drink bottles
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Primary Ferment</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Mix the sugar, salt, and water until mostly dissolved</li>
          <li>
            Add the kefir grains and the water solution to the fermenting jar
          </li>
          <li>Add the dried fig and lemon slice</li>
          <li>
            Put the fermenting jar on the bench or in a cupboard, out of direct
            sunlight
          </li>
          <li>
            After 24-48 hours, strain to separate the liquid from the solids
          </li>
          <li>
            Put the liquid into the storage bottle in the fridge, this is the
            kefir you drink
          </li>
          <li>
            Start again at step 1 with the grains in the sieve, you can reuse
            the fig and lemon a time or two
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Secondary Ferment</h3>
        Add extra flavours to the kefir in the fridge in a "secondary
        fermentation." You can try fresh fruit or juice, cordial, crystallised
        ginger or other dried fruit, small amounts of spices or tea leaves, etc.
        The kefir will keep fermenting any residual sugars and any new sugars
        you add. You can leave it at room temperature to get the secondary
        fermentation going faster, or put it straight in the fridge to slow it
        down. A few days to a week in the fridge is often a good amount, the
        flavour and sweetness will change as it ferments. Have fun!

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <details name="faq">
          <summary>What is a primary ferment?</summary>
          <p>
            This is just the initial fermentation you do by putting the kefir
            grains in a container with sugar water and letting it ferment for a
            day or two. It finishes once you strain the kefir grains out and
            start the process again.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep this step relatively simple and don't add extra ingredients.
            Too much sugar at this stage can cause the microbes to get out of
            balance. Things can get a bit slimy or overly yeasty, etc.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details name="faq">
          <summary>What is a secondary ferment?</summary>
          <p>
            Additional fermentation that happens after you've removed the kefir
            grains from the liquid, usually in the fridge with some extra fruit
            or flavouring in the bottle.
          </p>
          <p>
            After your primary ferment is finished and you've strained the
            grains out, you're left with the kefir you consume. At this point,
            the kefir is inoculated with all the bacteria and yeast from the
            kefir grains and will keep fermenting any residual sugars (and a
            bunch of other reactions.) Putting it in the fridge slows this extra
            fermentation down so it doesn't run out of sugars or get overly
            acidic. It's really up to you, it'll happily eat new sugars of any
            kind or be just as happy without.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep in mind that you're only adding these to the kefir you put in
            the fridge to consume, NOT in the primary ferment with the kefir
            grains.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details name="faq">
          <summary>What kind of container should I use?</summary>
          <p>
            For the primary ferment you want a jar or container between 0.5L and
            2L depending how much you want to make at once (you could go larger,
            it just gets unwieldy.) I find water kefir easy to drink so I make
            around 1.5L every 2 days. You could use food grade plastic or glass
            containers as long as they're designed to release pressure during
            fermentation. I use a large swing-top glass jar from Muji that
            naturally vents pressure before it gets explosive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Again, you want something that can handle pressure build up as water
            kefir can get quite fizzy. Swing top glass bottles, old soft drink
            bottles, or anything designed for beer or wine should work fine.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details name="faq">
          <summary>
            What should my water kefir look, smell, and taste like?
          </summary>
          <p>
            Straight out of the primary ferment it should taste and smell
            lightly acidic, mildly sweet, a little lemony or funky but not
            overly strong. You can often see light carbonation at this point.
            You can get different smells and flavours depending on the kind of
            sugar you use, the temperature you're fermenting at, whether you put
            figs and/or lemon slices in, etc. but mine hasn't ever been
            particularly intense after the primary ferment. The colour varies
            from a cloudy white for white sugar to yellow or orange for raw and
            brown sugars.
          </p>
          <p>
            The secondary ferment is likely to smell and taste like whatever you
            added to the kefir, plus a light acidity and some fizz. Again, it's
            not usually too strong tasting and it can be sweet or dry depending
            on how much sugar went into it thus far and how long it had to
            ferment that sugar away.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details name="faq">
          <summary>
            Should I cover my primary ferment with a lid or cheesecloth?
          </summary>
          <p>
            You can do either and you'll see varied beliefs online. I haven't
            noticed much of a difference either way so I just do what's easy. I
            believe oxygen flow (if you use cheesecloth for example) favours
            slightly different sets of microbes than a sealed lid but the kefir
            as a whole will be happy either way and you'll still be getting all
            the benefits. Do what's easy and works for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            I personally use a swing-top jar that lets carbon dioxide escape but
            is otherwise sealed, so limited oxygen for the kefir.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details name="faq">
          <summary>What temperature should I ferment at?</summary>
          <p>
            If the temperature is comfortable for you then it's also good for
            your kefir. 15-25C is ideal but it'll work outside of that too.
            Cooler will slow fermentation while hotter will speed it up. If it's
            uncomfortably hot for you where you're kefir is (say, above 30C)
            then you probably want to move it somewhere cooler. Your grains
            won't die unless they get above 40C for extended periods of time.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details name="faq">
          <summary>Is water kefir alcoholic?</summary>
          <p>
            Very slightly but it's usually low enough to be classified as a
            non-alcoholic beverage in Australia. It's unlikely to get over 1%
            alcohol by volume, usually less. I believe kefir produces about a
            quarter of the alcohol of brewers yeast for the same sugar inputs so
            you can theoretically optimise for higher alcohol but it's hard and
            you might as well make beer or wine at that point.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're finding it smells more yeasty or alcoholic than normal,
            try giving your grains a rinse under cold tap water before you do
            your next batch. Sometimes the yeasts can become more dominant and a
            wash seems to help. Even so, the alcohol content will never be high.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details name="faq">
          <summary>Can I use honey/milk/sugar replacement</summary>
          <p>Nope.</p>
          <p>
            Honey is way too rich (very fructose heavy) and has its own complex
            microbial and antimicrobial stuff going on so it's just not a good
            idea to mix the two.
          </p>
          <p>
            Milk kefir and water kefir are distinct, you can't use water kefir
            grains to make milk kefir or visa-versa. You <em>might</em> be able
            to ferment coconut water or some plant milks with water kefir grains
            but make sure you've got backup grains in case it all goes horribly
            wrong and you have to discard your experiment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sugar replacements are a straight up nope. Water kefir feeds on the
            sugar and sugar replacements have no sugar so the kefir grains will
            starve. Some sugar replacements even kill microbes because they look
            close enough to sugar that the microbe eats it but then provide no
            energy so the microbe dies.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're worried about the sugar content, try leaving the kefir in
            the fridge for a week and only adding minimal extra sugar for the
            second ferment. Water kefir can be quite dry if you let the microbes
            convert all the sugar to acids and other metabolites.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details name="faq">
          <summary>I have too many kefir grains</summary>
          <p>
            Happy grains will multiply, especially in warmer weather. This isn't
            necessarily a problem but can speed up your primary fermentation. I
            find water kefir grains are quite forgiving and I can make large or
            small amounts with varied amounts of grains, but you might want to
            slow it down.
          </p>
          <p>Here are some options to deal with having too many:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Put some to sleep. There's an FAQ section on taking a break, check
              that out. This doesn't get rid of them, but it does give you a
              backup if you want to experiment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Give them to friends. They'll need a tablespoon or two to get
              started.
            </li>
            <li>
              Blend them into a smoothie, they're apparently very good for you.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </details>
        <details name="faq">
          <summary>I'm going away / need a break</summary>
          <p>
            No worries, you can put your kefir grains to sleep for weeks to
            months at a time and they should be OK.
          </p>
          <p>
            For up to a few days, just put the grains in a jar in the fridge.
            For weeks, cover the grains with a small amount of sugar water and
            put it in the fridge, keeping in mind that it can still build up
            pressure during that time so either use a swing-top jar or open the
            lid every now and then.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also freeze kefir grains for months and restart the later.
            I've never done so but you can search online and find some
            instructions.
          </p>
          <p>
            They might be a little sluggish when you first pull them out of the
            fridge, especially if they've been in there a while, but they should
            perk back up if you start a regular rhythm again.

        <details name="faq">
          <summary>What are the kefir grains made of?</summary>
          <p>
            Their structure is provided by a polysaccharide called dextran,
            similar to cellulose, that one of the bacteria in the water kefir
            grains produces. Dextran clumps together to form the grains, and the
            grains provide a protective layer around the entire colony of
            microorganisms that live in there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dextran is perfectly safe to eat so there's no worries about eating
            the grains, accidentally or otherwise.

        <details name="faq">
          <summary>How clean does everything have to be?</summary>
          <p>
            I wash out my primary fermenting jar once every few weeks or if I
            notice lots of sediment. I was my storage bottles every time I
            finish the kefir in them, but you could keep refilling them for a
            while too. The kefir colony seems to murder any pathogens that get
            into it. I obviously use clean utensils and wash my strainer well
            each time, but the kefir grains seem quite robust as long as they're
            happy and healthy. Regular kitchen cleanliness seems to be enough.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fermenting websites love to talk about everything being perfectly
            sterile for each batch and that seems important for commercial
            production, but it's way overkill for home fermentation.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details name="faq">
          <summary>Where can I get kefir grains?</summary>
          <p>
            If you have a friend who makes water kefir, ask them for some. The
            grains replicate on their own so they'll have too many at some
            point. You only need around 1 tablespoon to get started.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also buy some online, they'll survive express post. I bought
            mine from
            <a href="https://www.thefermentary.com.au/">The Fermentary</a> but
            there are plenty of others.

          <summary>How does water kefir compare to probiotic tablets?</summary>
          <p>
            Milk kefir has more research behind it and seems to have higher
            diversity and more colony-forming units than water kefir, but water
            kefir still seems to have many of the same beneficial bacteria in
            relatively high amounts.
          </p>
          <p>
            All kinds of kefir will have more active probiotics than probiotic
            tablets because dried probiotics aren't very active. The specific
            strains in the kefir will vary by local environment, climate, and
            the grains you started with, similar to sourdough starter.
          </p>
          <p>
            From what I've read anecdotally, water kefir has similar success
            stories for stomach issues as milk kefir.
